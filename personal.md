- Built an application to log the working hours, leaves, and holidays in an organisation, and calculate overtimes for all employees
- Built a low-key database collaboration tool using Python
- iOS application for Expense calculation that protects your data and keeps it completely private
- Several attempts at building my personal website. (I like to test stuff, so this website has transitioned from various tools and servers)
