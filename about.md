Hi I am Varij. I am currently employed as Software Developer at IT Manufactory GmbH in a beautiful city of Passau, Germany.

I like programming and building new stuff and trying out new technologies. When I am not programming, I like to cycle and play Badminton, Cricket etc.

Recently I have started this new blog where I am planning to write about things I care about, and solutions to some common problems. This is not a typical Blog for tutorials or solutions to other problems, I write here about problems that I face, things that I have tried, or things that I want to remember.

A little more about me and a very basic resume:
